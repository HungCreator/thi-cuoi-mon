            Always up for a challenge, I have worked for lean start-ups <br />
            and was a member of the first New Zealand start-up to <br />
            attend Y Combinator, the largest start-up accelerator in the <br />
            world. From there, I worked my way up to Art Director and <br />
            Team Lead at Appster where I oversaw the design of 30+ <br />
            mobile and desktop apps. Currently I am a Senior Product <br />
            Designer at Linktree leading design for the Linktree mobile app
